- **Feature Separation**: Keep features in separate sections/pages to avoid UI bombardment
- **Design System**: Follow Walmart's brand colors (#0071ce blue, #ffc220 yellow) with minimalist, classy design
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strictly with proper interfaces and types
- **Performance**: Optimize for performance with code splitting and lazy loading

## Code Style

- Use functional components with React hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Follow React best practices and patterns
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling
- Maintain clean, readable code with proper TypeScript annotations

## Features to Implement

1. **Scanner Module** - AR/barcode scanning with distinct UI
